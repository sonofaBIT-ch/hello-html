<h1>Our first page</h1>

<h2>
    Why are we so excited?
</h2>

<p>
    Because we've never done anything like this before!
    This sentence is on a separate line, but it's still part of the same paragraph.
    In
    fact,
    this
    sentence
    is
    made
    up
    of
    multiple
    lines,
    but
    it's
    still
    part
    of
    the
    same
    paragraph.
</p>
<p>Also, we can have multiple paragraphs under one another!</p>

<h2>Where to from now?</h2>
<p>We're probably going to learn about more HTML tags and what not!</p>

<h2>So how would we add a line break if we so wanted?</h2>
<p>Well, obviously, we could always just put it in a different paragraph :)</p>
<p>Like this.</p>
<p>But if we wanted to keep it in the same paragraph, we could use the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>But if we wanted to break stuff (&#9786;), we could just do <code><br></code> tag. </p>
<p>If we added some extra spaces here        (like so)      nothing would happen.</p>
<p>But if we wanted to make the browser print some spaces, we could do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this</p>

<p>
    (1) Like this.<br>
    And this.<br>
    And this.
</p>

<p>Compare the above paragraph with the one below.</p>
<p>(2) Like this.</p>
<p>And this.</p>
<p>And this.</p>

<p>Or this:</p>
<p>
    (3) Like        this.
    And this.
    And this.
</p>






<p>Also, here's a longer example of the code tag: <code>foo bar idk just wanted to put something here</code></p>
